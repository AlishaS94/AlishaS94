Hi, I'm Alisha Soares. 

As an individual immersed science and technology, I am very interested in bioinformatics and the development of tools which can improve our assessment of the vast amount of data generated. Such tools are vital even in business and social settings. I hope to continue improving my skills and my ability to work on new and exciting projects.

Thank you for veiwing my repository.
