Hi, I'm Alisha Soares. 

As a student of science and technology, I am very interested in bioinformatics and the development of tools which can improve our assessment of the vast amount of data generated. Such tools vital even in business and social settings. I hope to continue improving my skills and my ability to work on new and exciting projects.

Thank you for veiwing my repository.
